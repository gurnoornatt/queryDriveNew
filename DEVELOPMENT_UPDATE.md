# Courier Optimizer Development Update

## Progress Summary

We have successfully completed Phase 1 of our development roadmap:

- [x] **DoorDash Drive Integration** - COMPLETED
  - [x] Built DoorDash Authentication (HMAC signature verification)
  - [x] Implemented `estimate()` functionality using official SDK
  - [x] Implemented `createDelivery()` functionality
  - [x] Implemented `parseWebhook()` functionality for delivery status updates
  - [x] Created `/webhooks/doordash` route with signature verification
  - [x] Added GET endpoint for browser testing of webhook endpoint
  - [x] Created comprehensive tests for all DoorDash functionality
  - [x] Added detailed documentation (README, TESTING_GUIDE, WEBHOOK_GUIDE)
  - [x] Created test scripts for both API and webhook testing

## Current Status

- All tests are passing
- The DoorDash integration is fully functional
- We can create deliveries, track their status, and process webhook events
- Webhook verification is working correctly with proper signature validation

## Next Tasks (Phase 2: Uber Direct Integration)

According to our development roadmap, Phase 2 focuses on Uber Direct integration. Here are the key tasks:

1. **Implement Uber Client Library**
   - Create OAuth token management with caching
   - Implement `estimate()` function for delivery cost quotes
   - Implement `createDelivery()` function
   - Implement `parseWebhook()` function for webhook processing

2. **Create Uber Webhook Handler**
   - Set up `/webhooks/uber` route
   - Implement signature verification for Uber webhooks
   - Process and store Uber status updates

3. **Test and Document Uber Integration**
   - Create unit and integration tests
   - Add documentation similar to DoorDash
   - Create test scripts for Uber API and webhooks

## Phase 3 Preparation: Courier Optimizer API

After completing the Uber Direct integration, we'll move to Phase 3 to build the optimization API:

1. **Setup Supabase Database**
   - Configure database tables (deliveries, provider_quotes, restaurants)
   - Implement Row Level Security (RLS)
   - Create database access layer

2. **Implement API Endpoints**
   - `/v1/delivery/quote` - Compare quotes from both providers
   - `/v1/delivery/dispatch` - Select cheaper provider and create delivery
   - `/v1/delivery/:id/status` - Check delivery status
   - `/v1/delivery/report` - Generate delivery performance reports

## Technical Debt & Improvements

These are items we should address as we move forward:

1. Fix type errors in test files (non-critical, tests are passing)
2. Implement retry logic for API rate limits and failures
3. Add more comprehensive error handling for edge cases
4. Enhance logging with proper PII redaction for personal information

## Environment Setup Requirements

For upcoming Uber integration, we'll need:

1. Uber Direct "Direct Fulfillment" API scope request
2. Uber API credentials (client ID/secret)
3. Webhook URL configuration in Uber developer dashboard

## Next Steps

The immediate next task is to implement the Uber Client Library (`clients/uber.ts`), including:
1. OAuth token management with proper caching
2. Delivery estimation functionality
3. Delivery creation and management
4. Webhook payload parsing and verification
