# DoorDash SDK Integration Summary

## Overview

This document provides a summary of the DoorDash SDK integration in our application, including implementation details, testing procedures, and key components.

## Implementation Components

### 1. DoorDash SDK Client (`src/clients/doordashSdk.ts`)
- Wrapper around the DoorDash SDK for delivery management
- Handles authentication, API calls, and webhook signature verification
- Implements error handling and request formatting

### 2. Webhook Handler (`src/routes/webhookRoutes.ts`)
- Exposes webhook endpoint at `/webhooks/doordash`
- Implements both GET (for testing) and POST (for receiving webhooks) handlers
- Verifies webhook signatures and processes events

### 3. Test Scripts
- `test-doordash-sdk.ts`: For testing delivery creation and management
- `test-doordash-webhook.sh`: For testing webhook endpoint functionality

## API Functionality

The integration supports the following DoorDash Drive API operations:

- **Get Delivery Quote**: Obtain cost and time estimates for deliveries
- **Create Delivery**: Create a new delivery request
- **Get Delivery Status**: Check status of existing deliveries
- **Cancel Delivery**: Cancel an active delivery
- **Update Delivery**: Modify details of an existing delivery

## Webhook Events Handling

The application processes the following webhook events:

- `delivery.status_update`: Updates delivery status in the database
- `delivery.created`: Confirms delivery creation
- `delivery.cancelled`: Handles delivery cancellations
- `delivery.quote_expired`: Manages expired quotes

## Testing and Validation

Testing is done through:

1. **Unit Tests**: For individual components (42 passing tests)
2. **Integration Tests**: For API interactions
3. **Manual Testing**:
   - Test script for creating deliveries: `npm run test:doordash`
   - Test script for webhooks: `npm run test:doordash-webhook`
   - DoorDash Developer Portal Simulator for delivery status simulation

## Production Readiness Checklist

- [x] Comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Retry mechanism for failed API calls (future enhancement)
- [ ] Database persistence for delivery status tracking (future enhancement)

## Documentation
